# Adeptly Training Implementation Changes

## Overview of Changes

The original Document Management System app has been completely transformed into "Adeptly" - a training platform for MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) engineering professionals. This document outlines the key changes and implementation details based on the requirements provided in the project PDF.

## Key Components Modified

1. **App Renaming**:
   - Renamed the app from 'app' to 'adeptly'
   - Updated all references in settings, URLs, and templates

2. **Database Models**:
   - Created models based on the schema in the PDF:
     - User (extends Django's built-in User model)
     - Topic (engineering topics for training)
     - Rank (experience levels)
     - Problem (training problems with multiple choice answers)
     - UserTopicStats (tracks user experience by topic)
     - TrainingSession (records training sessions)
     - TopicExperienceEarned (tracks experience earned)

3. **User Interface**:
   - Implemented the color scheme from the PDF (based on HVAC equipment)
   - Designed the UI for dashboards, training, and problem management
   - Created responsive layouts with Bootstrap and custom CSS

4. **Features Implemented**:
   - User authentication and profile management
   - Dashboard with user statistics
   - Custom training session creation
   - Interactive problem-solving interface
   - Training results and experience tracking
   - Problem management (CRUD operations)

5. **Additional Components**:
   - Custom management command for initialization
   - Context processor for global templates
   - Media handling for problem diagrams
   - Custom CSS for theming

## Implementation Notes

### Color Palette

The application uses the color scheme specified in the PDF:
- Light Gray: #DBE0DE
- Dark Blue: #172532
- Blue: #88B6CD
- Medium Gray: #7E8B90
- Light Blue-Gray: #B7C3BF

### Deployment Considerations

1. The application is configured to use PostgreSQL but will use SQLite for development
2. Media file handling is set up for user-uploaded diagrams
3. Static files are configured for deployment
4. A requirements.txt file includes all necessary dependencies

### Next Steps

1. Run migrations and initialize the database:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations adeptly
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py initialize_adeptly
   ```

2. Create an admin user:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. Access the admin panel to add more topics, problems, and users
